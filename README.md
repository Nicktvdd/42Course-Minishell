# MiniShell
:white_check_mark: Project completed with 101/100 points

Minishell allows to relive the challenges of the past, experiencing firsthand the problems faced when Windows was non-existent. Dive into the realm of interactive command lines, understanding the essence of this fundamental form of communication. With Minishell, we are exploring the past and the art of command-line mastery.

We worked on it as a group project with @rushmaverick, @jestebanpelaez18 and @composerjunhee. We all had a part in creating the completed project, after which we teached eachother our parts and made sure that everyone understood exactly what is going on. My main focus of the project was the architecture, group communication, pipes and bughunting.
